# Panasonic H&C Home Assistant Integration

This integration supports Bluetooth enabled wired remote controllers
for Panasonic reverse cycle air conditioning units supported by the
"Panasonic H&C Control" Andriod and iOS apps.

It is currently being developed and tested with the CZ-RTC6BLW controller.

It uses local BLE control and does not require any cloud connection or
registration.
